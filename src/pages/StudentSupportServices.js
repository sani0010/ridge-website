            <strong>Overseas Student Health Cover</strong>
            <p>
              Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) is a health insurance that covers the cost of visits to the doctor, some hospital treatment, ambulance cover, and some pharmaceuticals. International students must have OSHC while in Australia for the duration of their course of study. The OSHC must be paid before a student visa is issued.
              <br />
              Ridge International College can organise your OSHC cover. Contact our Student Services. You can find out more about OSHC at www.health.gov.au or at www.study.vic.gov.au
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>Full Time Study</strong>
            <p>
              Australian law requires international students to undertake a full-time study load. A full-time study load is normally a minimum of 20 hours per week for at least 40 weeks each calendar year or continuous 12-month period.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>Attendance</strong>
            <p>
              International students studying VET courses are expected to attend all classes to facilitate effective learning. Ridge International College monitors student attendance in accordance with its Attendance Policy and requires students to attend 80% of their scheduled classes. However, students in VET courses at Ridge International College will be reported to the Department of Home affairs (DHA) only on the basis of unsatisfactory course progress (see Academic Progress).
              <br />
              Please refer to attendance policy at www.ridge.edu.au/policies

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Change of Address</h2>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
          Upon arriving in Australia, you are required to advise Ridge International College of your residential address, email address, mobile phone number and emergency contact details. Any changes to these details must be notified to Ridge International College within 7 days of the change. It is extremely important that students notify Ridge International College of a change of address as, under Section 20 of the ESOS Act 2000, Ridge International College is obliged to serve a notice at your last known address if you breach a student visa condition relating to attendance or academic performance.
          <br />
          Ridge International College may also send warning notices to you to help prevent breaches of your visa conditions. As per Tuition Protection Service (TPS) update, international students are required to update their current address at least every six months. It is your responsibility and in your own interests to ensure that your address details are always up to date.
