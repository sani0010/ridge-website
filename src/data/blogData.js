//       summary: 'As an international student, every day brings new experiences and challenges. My day typically starts at 7 AM, when I head to the campus caf√© for a quick breakfast before my 8:30 AM Economics class. The diversity in the classroom is incredible - we have students from over 15 different countries One of the most interesting aspects of my day is the cultural exchange that happens naturally during lunch breaks. We often share traditional snacks from our home countries and discuss how university life differs across cultures. The afternoon is usually packed with study sessions in the library, where Ive found a great study group. We help each other not just with academics, but also in understanding cultural nuances and adapting to life in a new country. Evening activities often include participating in international student society events, where we organize cultural festivals, language exchange programs, and support sessions for new international students. These activities have helped me build a strong community away from home.',

//       details: `Balancing work and studies is like walking on a tightrope - it requires focus, balance, and constant adjustment. Through my journey as a working student, I've developed strategies that helped me excel in both areas.
  
//       Time management is crucial. I use the Pomodoro Technique for studying, breaking my work into 25-minute focused sessions. This helps me maintain concentration and make the most of my limited study time.
      
//       Communication with professors and employers is key. I've found that most are understanding and flexible if you're upfront about your commitments. Many professors have offered alternative assignment deadlines, and my employer allows me to adjust my schedule during exam periods.
      
//       The biggest lesson I've learned is the importance of self-care. Despite busy schedules, taking time for rest and recreation is essential for long-term success.`,

//       details: `My semester in Melbourne was a transformative experience that changed my perspective on education and life. The Australian approach to learning, with its emphasis on independent research and practical application, was refreshingly different from what I was used to.
  
//       Melbourne's coffee culture became an integral part of my student life. I found that some of my best study sessions happened in the city's hidden laneway cafes. The blend of academic and cultural experiences made every day an adventure.
      
//       One of the highlights was participating in field research projects that took us to the Great Ocean Road and the Grampians. These hands-on experiences taught me more about environmental science than any textbook could.
      
//       The challenges of adapting to a new educational system and culture were real, but the support from local students and faculty made the transition smoother. I've made lifelong friends and professional connections that I know will be valuable in my future career.`,
